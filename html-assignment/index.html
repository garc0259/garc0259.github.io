            <h2>About me</h2>
        
            <p>I am an <em>International Student</em> at <strong>Algonquin College</strong>, currently taking up <strong>Interactive Media Design.</strong> I am from The Philippines. However, I was working full time as a Senior Graphic Designer within several companies in Dubai, <abbr title="United Arab Emirates">UAE</abbr> since 2006. I arrived here in Canada last 24<sup>th</sup> April 2023 and I find Ottawa amazing.</p>

            <p>I am excited to be back in school, my favorite thing to do in class is to listen to the lessons carefully and interact with my fellow classmates. I took up this program as I believe it will open many opportunities, advancements in my chosen career and add value to my personal development. Five years from now, I see myself to be successfully managing a team in a creative environment or looking after a business of my own. </p>
